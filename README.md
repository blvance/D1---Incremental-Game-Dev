The following app, Dookie Clicker, is a clicker game were the player clicks on a dookie. So far the button and counter have been implemented. Put in an image of a dookie for the clicker.

Implemented step 5 before the others on accident by making the Burger upgrade cost minus from the total number of Dookies. I also implemented the setInterval to make the Shrek autoclicker.

Made a requestAnimationFrame to smoothly animate the counter for the shrek auto clicker instead of setInterval. Added UI detail and pazzaz to give the gane a bit more feeling to the game. Playtested and made sure that numbers scale proportionalitly. Implemented that when the player doesn't have enough dookie the buttons disable.

_Joshua Kim-Pearson_ - Added burger upgrade as a crossover from my burger clicker that ups the click power
